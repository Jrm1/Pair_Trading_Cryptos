## Pair_Trading_Cryptos

The spread.py code goes through the list of 100 cryptos and computes the rolling ols spread in terms of zScore. Then it plots the spread and the beta coefficient that defines the spread.

Note that for convenience you can copy the code piece by piece on a Jupyter notebook and debug it there. However I think makes more sense  here to commit to a classic .py file
